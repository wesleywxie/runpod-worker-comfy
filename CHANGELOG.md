- simplified input to just have "prompt", removed unused code ([0c3ccda](https://github.com/blib-la/runpod-worker-comfy/commit/0c3ccda9c5c8cdc56eae829bb358ceb532b36371))
- updated path to "comfyui", added "ntpdate" to have the time of the container in sync with AWS ([2fda578](https://github.com/blib-la/runpod-worker-comfy/commit/2fda578d62460275abec11d6b2fbe5123d621d5f))
- use local ".env" to load env variables, mount "comfyui/output" to localhost so that people can see the generated images ([aa645a2](https://github.com/blib-la/runpod-worker-comfy/commit/aa645a233cd6951d296d68f7ddcf41b14b3f4cf9))
- use models from huggingface, not from local folder ([b1af369](https://github.com/blib-la/runpod-worker-comfy/commit/b1af369bb577c0aaba8875d8b2076e1888356929))
- wait until server is ready, wait until image generation is done, upload to s3 ([ecfec13](https://github.com/blib-la/runpod-worker-comfy/commit/ecfec1349da0d04ea5f21c82d8903e1a5bd3c923))
